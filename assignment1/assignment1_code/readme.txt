
PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE : Python

CODE STRUCTURE : 
1. Node class is used to deine a node and perform node operations.
2. code reads from the command line arguments and see whether it is uniformed or informed search will call the asked method.
3. In the find_route method first read the input files and source and destination city.
4. Make a graph by reading paths from the input and then find path from the graph using queue(frienge)
5. When the Queue gets empty, Print the value of nodes expanded, nodes generated , max nodes in memory, distance and the whether path is found from source to destination or not found and in case path is found print the path.

INSTRUCTIONS :
I used anaconda Prompt (anaconda3) to run the code
To run program make sure that the given input file and the code file are in the same folder

1- To run Uninformed Search Program: python find_route.py input1.txt source destination

2- To run Informed Search Program: python find_route.py input1.txt source destination h_kassel.txt
